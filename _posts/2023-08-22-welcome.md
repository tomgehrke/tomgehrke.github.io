# Hello!

My name is Tom Gehrke and, like most of you, I think about a lot of things. Some of these are things I want to remember for later use. Others are things that other people might find interesting. Sometimes I may just want to put thoughts out in the world and see what happens.

Regardless, this is the place where all of that will go down.

Granted, things are pretty sparse right now, but I hope to start adding items regularly. I suspect it won't be long before you'll be wishing I'd shut up for a minute.
